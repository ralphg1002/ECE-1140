I have created a PLC.txt file and a parser which takes the txt file and parses the data and completes the operations based on the information provided.
Currently, It only checks for a single "IF" block. But I would like it so that if there are multiple IF conditions for each switch section like the code I have added after the methods,
I would like it to first evaluate the condition in the first IF statement and if it evaluates the condition as true, it should not evaluate the second condition in the section IF section (within the same switch section)


# Define a function to parse the text file
    def parse_text_file(self, filename):
        data = []  # List to store the parsed data
        currentSection = None  # Variable to track the current section
        insideIf = False  # Flag to indicate if we are inside an IF block
        condition = None
        operations = []  # List to store multiple operations

        with open(filename, "r") as file:
            for line in file:
                line = line.strip()

                if line.startswith("SW"):
                    currentSection = line

                    insideIf = True
                    operations = []  # Initialize operations list for this IF block
                elif insideIf and line.startswith("Condition"):
